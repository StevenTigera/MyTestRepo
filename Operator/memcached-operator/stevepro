export IMG="g/td/c/t/s/example.com/memcached-operator:v0.0.4"
make docker-build

docker tag example.com/memcached-operator:v0.0.4 g/td/c/t/s/example.com/memcached-operator:v0.0.4
docker push g/td/c/t/s/example.com/memcached-operator:v0.0.4

make install
k get Memcached
I had an entry
memcached-sample
believe this camer from here:
cache_v1alpha1_memcached.yaml

OR to run locally
make install run
make deploy IMG=g/td/c/t/s/example.com/memcached-operator:v0.0.4

works but got make error at the end - not sure if this is important
make: *** No rule to make target 'gcr.io/tigera-dev/cnx/tigera/stevepro/example.com/memcached-operator:v0.0.3'.  Stop.


I had an error with pull image down on deploy because there was no secret to pull from private container registry
I tried to create the secret and redo but still error out


BUT can apply resource
e.g.
k get memcacheds.cache.example.com -o yaml
No resources

k apply -f config/samples/cache_v1alpha1_memcached.yaml
